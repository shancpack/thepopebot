Locate and provide access to the Shopify credentials file. The job should:

1. Search the entire repository for Shopify credentials files (including any that might be gitignored or hidden)
2. Check if the credentials exist in any backup locations or previous commits
3. If found, create a secure way to access the credentials file (either by temporarily ungitignoring it, creating a copy in a downloadable location, or providing the file contents in a secure format)
4. If the file was gitignored, temporarily make it accessible for download while maintaining security best practices
5. Provide clear instructions on how to download or access the credentials file
6. Include any necessary setup steps to restore the file to where your Claude code setup expects to find it

The goal is to get you immediate access to your Shopify credentials for download.
